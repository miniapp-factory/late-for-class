+Code the following app
+```
+Develop a fully functional single-player endless runner game titled 'Late for Class' focused on high-speed reaction.
+
+1. Visuals & Assets:
+
+Style: Generate 'cute cartoon vector' style assets for the game.
+
+Player: A student character running with a backpack.
+
+Obstacles: Varied stacks of textbooks and piles of paper.
+
+Theme: Use a strict University Green and Gold color palette for the background gradient and UI elements to match the USM school spirit.
+
+2. Core Gameplay Mechanics:
+
+The student runs automatically from left to right.
+
+Physics: Implement smooth gravity. When the user taps the screen or presses the Spacebar, the student jumps. Holding the input longer should NOT affect jump height (fixed jump arc).
+
+Difficulty: The scrolling speed of the obstacles must gradually increase every 10 seconds to make the game harder.
+
+Collision: If the student touches a book stack, the game stops immediately.
+
+3. User Interface:
+
+Home Screen: Display the title 'Late for Class' with a pulsing 'Start Run' button.
+
+HUD: Show a high-contrast 'Distance Score' in the top right corner that updates in real-time.
+
+Game Over: Show a 'You are Late!' overlay with the final score and a 'Retake Subject' button that instantly restarts the game without reloading the page.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+Fix #1: The Colors (Contrast & Readability)
+The gradient is too bright, making the text impossible to read. Let's fix the branding.
+
+"Update the styling to be more readable. Change the main page background to a solid dark green (#0A3815). Change all text color to White so it stands out. Make the game canvas background a dark grey (#333333) to look like a road, and draw a gold line at the bottom to represent the floor."
+
+Fix #2: The Graphics (From Squares to "Student")
+
+"Update the game graphics using Canvas drawing commands.
+
+Player: Instead of a plain square, draw a blue rectangle for the body and a yellow circle on top for the head. Add a small brown rectangle on the back for a backpack.
+
+Obstacle: Draw the obstacle as a brown rectangle with white horizontal stripes, so it looks like a stack of books."

+
+3. Fix Score & UI:
+
+Display the Distance Score clearly in the top-right corner of the canvas using large Gold text.
+
+Game Over: When a collision happens, show a "LATE!" popup with the Final Score and a "Retake Class" button to restart instantly.

+Fix the bugs in the 'Late for Class' game:
+
+1. Fix the Backwards Runner:
+
+The runner emoji is facing the wrong way. Flip the player emoji horizontally using ctx.scale(-1, 1) so the student faces the right side of the screen (towards the obstacles).
+
+2. Fix the Score Counter:
+
+The score is stuck at 0. Ensure the score variable increments by 1 in every frame of the game loop.
+
+Force the UI to update: document.getElementById('score-hud').innerText = ... inside the animation loop.
+
+3. Visual Polish:
+
+Make the "Distance: 0m" text inside the canvas Gold and bigger (30px).
+
+Keep the University Green background for the page.
