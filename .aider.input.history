+Code the following app
+```
+Develop a fully functional single-player endless runner game titled 'Late for Class' focused on high-speed reaction.
+
+1. Visuals & Assets:
+
+Style: Generate 'cute cartoon vector' style assets for the game.
+
+Player: A student character running with a backpack.
+
+Obstacles: Varied stacks of textbooks and piles of paper.
+
+Theme: Use a strict University Green and Gold color palette for the background gradient and UI elements to match the USM school spirit.
+
+2. Core Gameplay Mechanics:
+
+The student runs automatically from left to right.
+
+Physics: Implement smooth gravity. When the user taps the screen or presses the Spacebar, the student jumps. Holding the input longer should NOT affect jump height (fixed jump arc).
+
+Difficulty: The scrolling speed of the obstacles must gradually increase every 10 seconds to make the game harder.
+
+Collision: If the student touches a book stack, the game stops immediately.
+
+3. User Interface:
+
+Home Screen: Display the title 'Late for Class' with a pulsing 'Start Run' button.
+
+HUD: Show a high-contrast 'Distance Score' in the top right corner that updates in real-time.
+
+Game Over: Show a 'You are Late!' overlay with the final score and a 'Retake Subject' button that instantly restarts the game without reloading the page.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
